# 🚀 College Programs: My CS Journey

Welcome to **College Programs** — my digital CS notebook!  
This repository is a collection of everything I learn while pursuing my **Computer Science** degree — from foundational concepts to advanced algorithms, from writing clean C programs to exploring the power of Python.

If I code it, learn it, or explore it — you'll find it here.
