# List Operations Problem01ðŸ¥¸

## Problem:

Consider a list ( `list = []`). You can perform the following commands:
-1. `insert i e`: Insert integer e at position i.
-2. `print`: Print the list.
-3. `remove e`: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
-4. `append e`: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
-5. `sort`: Sort the list.
-6. `pop`: Pop the last element from the list.
-7. `reverse`: Reverse the list.

Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.
### Example
```
N = 4
append 1
append 2
insert 13
print
```

-append 1: Append 1 to the list, `arr = [1].`</br>
-append 2: Append 2 to the list, `arr = [1, 2].`</br>
-insert 1 3: Insert 3 at index 1, `arr = [1,3,2].`</br>
-print: Print the array.

### Output:
```
[1, 3, 2]
```
### Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of commands.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.

### Constraints
The elements added to the list must be integers.
### Output Format
For each command of type print, print the list on a new line.
### Sample Input O
```
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print
```
### Sample Output 0
```
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
```
